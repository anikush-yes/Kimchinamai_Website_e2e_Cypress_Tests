11.Test.SearchingForaNon-ExistentProduct.cy.js

Bug Description: When searching for a non-existent product, no error message ("No results found") appears, even though the product does not exist in the system. The system should display a clear error message indicating that the product is unavailable or not found.

Bug Steps:

Open the homepage.
Click on the Prekių paieška (Search) icon.
Enter a non-existent product name (e.g., "Duona").
Expected behavior: The system should show a "No results found" message.
Actual behavior: No error message is shown, and no indication appears that the product was not found.
Expected Result: The system should display a clear message such as "No results found" when searching for a product that doesn't exist.

Actual Result: No error message or notification appears when searching for a non-existent product.

This kind of bug suggests that the system does not handle the "no results" case properly and needs to show an appropriate error message when no matching product is found.
